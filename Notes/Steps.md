## a -> b
1. Create (sorted) version of (a): **ft_pre_sort_stack.c**
2. Use (sorted) to define "pos" variable of (a): Done
3. Push to (b) all elements whith "pos" less than "stack size / 2":Done
4. Push all remaining element to (b) except for the 3 biggest nodes:Done
5. Check if the index of the node to push to (a) is the right one. Assuming that we are looking for the cheapest being 0 else the smallest: DONE
6. Write function to rotate and position (a) in the right spot to receive incoming b_node.
